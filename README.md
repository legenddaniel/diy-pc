# Provincial Population Data

Bootstrap-style OOCSS

3D Transform

`<input type="month">` bad browser support

No sprites due to the complicated calculation of the background-position for calc() without preprocessor

Due to the normal concensus that larger screen should display more content, small font size issue on some models of mobile phones would not be fixed

Bugs:

    On Safari unload / pagehide not triggered

    On Firefox the province images keep flickering despite preload and cache

    On Edge, Safari and mobile Firefox due to compatibility no smooth scroll
