# Provincial Population Data

This statistics was done at Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct every year from 1946 to 2015.
The provincial statistics starts from 1951-07-01.

Bootstrap-style OOCSS

3D Transform

`<input type="month">` bad browser support

No sprites due to the complicated calculation of the background-position for calc() without preprocessor

Due to the normal concensus that larger screen should display more content, small font size issue on some models of mobile phones would not be fixed

Due to the layout setting, keyboard navigation is cancelled. Use pointers to reach the elements.

Due to a solution conflict, now the page will go back to top after resize, orientation change and refresh.

On Edge, Safari and mobile Firefox due to compatibility no smooth scroll

Bugs:

    1. On Safari unload / pagehide event not triggered.

    1. On Safari the address/menu bar are counted as window.innerHeight leading to a layout mess-up.

    1. On Safari when changing orientation the layout might be messed up,
        try refreshing and then use full screen or portrait mode,
        or double tap the page to restore to normal.

    1. On Firefox the province images keep flickering despite preload and cache

    1. On Android the date picker indicator cannot be hidden.

    1. On Edge the slot machine widget (province selector) might have a flicker due to unknown reason. Partially fixed by a forced repaint when rolling the widget to make it look better.
